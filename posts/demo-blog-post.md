# Demo blog post - H1 will be my title 
###### Jun 29, 2025 ☕

Note that the date above will be a H6 

## H3 will represent big topics

Now I want to test couple things:

#### Hello from Kotlin
```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello, world!")
}
```

#### Hello from Compose
```kotlin
@Composable
fun MessageCard(name: String) {
    Text(text = "Hello $name!")
}
```

Ok, that seems to _cool_
